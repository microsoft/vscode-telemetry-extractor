# Telemetry Extractor for VS Code and associated source repositories

**Note**: This tool currently does not work in Windows CMD prompt or Powershell. On Windows you will need to use WSL or some other linux-like shell.

This tooling allows for the extraction of [GDPR formatted comments](./documentation/comment-code-annotations.md) from the VS Code source repository and
produces a JSON file containing the telemetry events which are collected.

## Prerequisites

* Node LTS (16.x) installed and in your path

## Setup

```bash
    npm i @vscode/telemetry-extractor
```

For the various supported commands please see [**Using the tool**](./documentation/using-the-tool.md)
